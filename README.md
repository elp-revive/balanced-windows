# balanced-windows
> Keep windows balanced

[![CI](https://github.com/elp-revive/balanced-windows/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/elp-revive/balanced-windows/actions/workflows/test.yml)

This Emacs package provides a global minor mode named `balanced-windows-mode`. When enabled, Emacs will automatically balance windows (keeping them roughly the same size) whenever the window configuration changes, e.g. after splitting or deleting a window.

## Installation

```elisp
(use-package balanced-windows
  :config
  (balanced-windows-mode))
```
